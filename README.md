# Not-Yet-Awesome Rust

A curated list of Rust code and resources that do **NOT** exist yet, but would be beneficial to the Rust community.

The purpose of this list is twofold:

* Enumerate **specific use cases and their problems domains** that do not yet have a robust ecosystem in Rust.
    * The definition of "specific" and "robust" for this list is yet to be determined!
* Encourage the Rust community to approach gaps in the Rust ecosystem by providing this list as a point of collaboration!

See the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on what you can do to help or if you have questions about this list!

## The List

### Documentation

### Stack Overflow

* There are many older Rust questions on Stack Overflow that wouldn't work with today's Rust because of syntax that has changed since the release of 1.0, or that may have better solutions because of other Rust ecosystem developments.
    * See [#4](https://github.com/ErichDonGubler/not-yet-awesome-rust/issues/4) for an SO query and a list of these known issues!

### Libraries

#### Data forensics
* Ability to parse `Registry.pol` files from Windows machines
