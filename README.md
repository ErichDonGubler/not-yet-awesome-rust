# Not-Yet-Awesome Rust

A curated list of Rust code and resources that do **NOT** exist yet, but would be beneficial to the Rust community.

The purpose of this list is twofold:

* Enumerate **specific use cases and their problems domains** that do not yet have a robust ecosystem in Rust.
    * The definition of "specific" and "robust" for this list is yet to be determined!
* Encourage the Rust community to approach gaps in the Rust ecosystem by providing this list as a point of collaboration!

See the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on what you can do to help or if you have questions about this list!

## The List

### Data forensics
* Ability to parse `Registry.pol` files from Windows machines

### Math / machine learning / data scienc
* Sparse matrix libraries (SPRS library needs a lot of love)
* Machine learning toolkit like scikit-learn in Python (both rust-learn and rusty-machine are insufficient)
* Deep learning toolkit with GPU support a good flexibility (think Tensorflow or Chainer in Python)
